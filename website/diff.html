      <td valign="top"><b><font color="#993399">It's Free</font></b><br>
- Well, for one thing, it's FREE. But that's really only the beginning.<br>
      <div align="center"> <br>
      <div align="left"><font color="#993399"><b>It's Open-source</b></font><br>
      </div>
      </div>
- The code is open-source. One thing about professional jyotish applications
is that you can never be sure how various things are being calculated. It's
often the case that when you check two jyotish programs against each other,
there are different results. And then when you check with a third, to determine
who is correct, you get a third result. I find that pretty frustrating. With
FreeJyotish, at least you can look at the code and see how each step is being
calculated and decide for yourself if it's correct or not. On top of it, the
code can be inspected by jyotishis, and corrected by the jyotish community
at large. This means that, over time, it can get more and more accurate.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#993399"><b>It's a "Black Box" for Jyotish</b></font><br>
- FreeJyotish is more than just a desktop application. It is, in a sense,
a "black box" for jyotish. It is designed to work as a back-end for any front
end you may want to design. And each of the widgets (like the Horoscopes,
or the data tables, etc.) are modular and can be easily placed into a new
frame in any way you like. Furthermore, this "black box" can be altered to
run on many different platforms, like PDAs, websites, etc. Probably you could
even rig it to run on a java-enabled cell phone without too much trouble.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#993399"><b>It's Pluggable</b></font><br>
- FreeJyotish is pluggable. We are going to great lengths to build a plug-in
capability into FreeJyotish. That means that if there are features you want,
you can build the plugin to do them and drop it into FJ. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#993399"><b>You Can Change It</b></font><br>
- If you don't like it, change it! The FreeJyotish project freely offers its
code to the world. As long as you don't sell what you make (that would be
a violation of FJ's license and a serious offense), you have the right to
make FreeJyotish look/act any way you want it too. Knock yourself out.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#993399"><b>It's Non-ideological</b></font><br>
- FreeJyotish is non-ideological. That means we are not going to make you
believe that our way of doing jyotish is the only correct way. In fact, even
we don't agree about what the correct way is. There are so many choices about
how to practice jyotish. That's why FreeJyotish has so many options. We want
to allow every jyotishi the dignity to do it his/her own way. If the options
you want aren't there, help us get them into the codebase, so that others
may benefit from your wisdom<br>

      <div align="center">
      <div align="left"><font color="#993399"><b>It's Forever</b></font><br>
      </div>
- FreeJyotish is forever. Other programs go defunct, go offline, or go out
of business. When the author stops working on them, they may stop growing
for years at a time, or even forever - leaving you stuck. Because FreeJyotish
is a community project, it is always growing and evolving. As long as there
are interested people who what to keep it going FreeJyotish will flourish.</div>
