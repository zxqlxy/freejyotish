<span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"><span
 style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;">16 FEB 03</span> </span><br>
- created NativeInfo2 class, a better NativeInfo object. Soon, I'll
rename it<br>
to NativeInfo and get rid of the old one<br>
- created NativeToXML class. This is a first attempt at developing a<br>
persistence strategy for FreeJyotish<br>
- wrote an XMLTester to test output of the writer.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"> 21 FEB 03</span><br>
- Finally got XML reader working. As usual, a very small feature in the
code<br>
was causing huge problems. Can't believe I wasted so much time trying to<br>
figure out this one little thing. At least it's working now.<br>
- Implemented the reading/writing of groups of natives to XML. After a
debacle<br>
wherein the writing looped indefinitely, creating an XML file almost
400 Megs<br>
in size before I shut it down, I was finally able to reign it in, and
get it<br>
to do most of what I wanted. This is an interesting point, because now
for the<br>
first time, I can get the ChartCenter up and running the way it should
be. <br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"> 24 FEB 03</span><br>
- Began adding XML backend to ChartCenter. Now when program boots, it
loads in<br>
all the charts stored in XML file. Made a quick JList to display this
on the<br>
main frame. Worked fine. Need to make this list component a separate
class<br>
derived from JList that will offer a lot of functionality, and can be
imported<br>
into various containers and subcontainers throughout the program. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 25 FEB 03</span><br>
- Created separate JList class for Native List. Learned out to map
objects into<br>
a JList component (by giving object an overridden toString() method that<br>
displays the object correctly in the JList).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 03 MAR 03</span><br>
- Reworked ChartCalculator to use NativeInfo2 objects<br>
- Got FJListPanel widget working with program controls, so that Native
selected<br>
is loaded into view.<br>
- Downloaded jUnit and installed both in classpath and with Ant<br>
- Read a little about using jUnit with Ant<br>
- Did some planning about how the ChartCenter has to handle Chart
objects<br>
(will they be too big to load hundreds of them into memory?)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 04 MAR 03</span><br>
- Created AllPlanetsToXML writer. Successfully outputs each Planet with
name,<br>
number, longitude, latitude, and velocity. Done in record time!<br>
- Lots of conceptualization on paper.<br>
- Began writing test jUnit test (suspended)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 09 MAR 03</span><br>
- Created a way to change any time zone with any dst value to GMT.
Implemented it in FJ already.<br>
Testing going perfectly well. <br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"> 12 MAR 03</span><br>
- Have worked extensively on the chart calculation preferences api in
the past<br>
couple of days. About half way there, currently.<br>
- upgraded the FJ home site, and learned a little about working on it<br>
- Finally got charts calculating through the Chart Center. The front end<br>
updates via hearing a ChartCenterChangedEvent. <br>
- Created calculation button in FJList that calculates charts <br>
- Got the FJList to update itself when chart center changes.<br>
- Got HoroscopeCanvas to update itself (independant of FJMainFrame)
when chart<br>
center changes (Magnum opus of the evening)<br>
- Added name label to HoroscopeCanvas<br>
- Added "Calculation Preferences" selection to "Options" menu<br>
- Switched things so that all interested objects register themselves
with the<br>
Chart Center on instatiation<br>
- And a thousand other little things<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 13 MAR 03</span><br>
- created IFJStorage interface<br>
- installed new widgets in FJMainFrameSplit to test just how
independant they<br>
are - working<br>
- Got the BasicTablePanel to update itself automatically<br>
- Worked on Ant task "web_release" which automatically uploads website
to<br>
SF.net.&nbsp; Still trying to get it to gunzip the file on SF.net,
however<br>
- Cleaned up the binary /ephe files on SF.net - still have to test them,<br>
however<br>
- Completely revamped API into 3 part structure (freejyotish.main,<br>
freejyotish.store, freejyotish.gui) - Magnum Opus of the evening<br>
- Changed CVS to reflect API change<br>
- Got Vimshottari Panel to update itself correctly<br>
- Cleaned all possible junk code out of FJMainFrame<br>
- Began getting the CalcPrefsDialog wired up<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-weight: bold;"> 15 MAR 03</span><br>
- Got HouseData printing to xml<br>
- Made xml handler for AllPlanets data - tested read/write: working fine<br>
- Attempted to use Castor to marshall/unmarshall objects - doesn't work
because several classes use HashMap, which Castor can't handle - Waste
of time<br>
- Made xml writer for Chart objects<br>
- Almost got a Chart object xml reader working - some glitches
remain... will get it working...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 17 MAR 03</span><br>
- Created a back end that works using Java serialization. Much, much
quicker to create than the XML backend. Good for testing in this early
phase. Also, helped me to weed out how much code was really
interface-based, and how much was incorrectly tied to the xml classes
that implement the interface.<br>
- Created a quick, simple input dialog for making new charts. The one
we had been working on (and will implement one of these days) was just
too slick and complex for efficient work. Made something much more down
to earth - no error checking, no instructions, but *it works*. <br>
- Uday moving forward strongly on the gui end of things.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 20 MAR 03</span><br>
- Horrible computer decompensation yesterday, had to reload the
operating system, etc. Lost everything. Luckily, CVS was up to date with
most of it (except the experimental stuff...). Lost my update list on my
home computer. Good thing it was posted here as well ;)<br>
- Found an open-source astrology font (glyphs and symbols) yesterday.
Looking forward to getting this <br>
- Most of today spent getting Mandrake 9.0 up and running, as well as
the system configured for java development. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 21 MAR 03</span><br>
- Made an extensive list of everything that needs doing on the gui.
Well, not everything, but the list is long enough as it is...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 22 MAR 03</span><br>
- Got my mx back up and running pretty good with the help from the
folks on the LULA (Linux Users Los Angeles) mailing list. <br>
- Created a new widget today "FJNativeDisplay" which will display all
information about the current chart. Built about half the necessary
guts. Working fine. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 23 MAR 03</span><br>
- Fixed the deletion problem in SerialCenter<br>
- Implemented saving of ChartCalcPrefs in SerialCenter<br>
- Separated (at least some) of SerialCenter coder from ChartCenter<br>
- Cleaned up lots of dead/test code from various files<br>
- Fixed a glitch in FJListPanel that choked on a chart deletion<br>
- etc.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 25 MAR 03</span><br>
- Began creation of new Chart Calculation pkg.<br>
- Added new pkg "freejyotish.main.calc" to cvs<br>
- Began moving relevant files to new pkg.<br>
- Began writing of various Calculation code bits<br>
- Wrote PanchangI.java <br>
- Created BasicsI.java - half written<br>
- Added new files to cvs<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 27 MAR 03</span><br>
- Completed the ant "web release" task (see 13 Mar 03) with help from
Peter Reilly of the Ant Users List. Task now takes all web content on
local machine, tars it, zips it, uploads it to sourceforge.net, unzips
it, untars it, and cleans all artifacts from the directory. So uploading
these pages now requires a single command line "ant web_release".
Thanks, Peter.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 4 APR 03</span><br>
- Uday has been working heavily on the SimpleInputDialog for the last
week. It's starting to work really well<br>
- I did research related to creating a sane, flexible, powerful
calculation engine. Read up on Java patterns. I believe that the correct
pattern for the freejyotish.main.calc package overall is the Builder
pattern. That is the direction I'll be heading when writing this package<br>
- Created the CalculationInformationRequiredException class - the first
of a couple of freejyotish.main.calc Exception classes suited to
reporting anything going wrong in the calculation guts of FJ. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 5 APR 03</span><br>
- Created 7 new classes, the beginnings of the core of the
freejyotish.main.calc package. None of these are remotely finished, but
it's beginning to take shape.<br>
- Brought a new programmer/jyotishi on board. Welcome Ken to the
project. Looking forward to working with him.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 11 APR 03</span><br>
- Worked out some minor bugs in the SimpleInputDialog<br>
- Added second logo possibility to /images<br>
- More planning of freejyotish.main.calc pkg.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 12 APR 03</span><br>
- Re-set up jyotish developers' mailing list<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 13 APR 03</span><br>
- Got a new astrology glyph font for FJ. Started integrating it into
the program. Wrote the constants necessary to using this font to
FJConstants file.<br>
- Began creating new, simplified NativeInfo2 persistence mech. This is
now the third persistence strategy for FreeJyotish. An attempt to get
very simple. The XML mech works fine, but is bloated. The java
serialization mechanism makes it so the slightest change in the code
invalidates all the saved charts. So this is an attempt to make a very
direct and simple "|" delimited file that saves only the birth data for
each chart. This will mean re-working (again) the entire ChartCenter to
adapt it back to saving NativeInfo2 objects instead of Chart objects.
When loading saved charts, all chart data will be recalculated.<br>
- Added "WriteNativeFile" class to cvs. <br>
- Created "DebugWindow" class to have an easy place to see the JVM
output. Integrated the window into "FJSplit", but still haven't hooked
it up to live output. Added to cvs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 14 APR 03</span><br>
- Began adding appropriate NativeInfo2 handling code to ChartCenter<br>
- Made relevant changes in IChartCenter<br>
- Fleshed out the WriteNativeFile class and tested its writing. Works
fine for single NativeInfo2 objects. Next have to make it print all
NativeInfo2's in memory.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 17 APR 03</span><br>
- In a late-night, full moon (2 LIB 30) mini-spree, I got the
ReadNativeFile up and running. Tested in in tandem with the
WriteNativeFile, reading and writing the same file several times to make
sure the end results were the same as the input. No problem. My next
chunk of work on this should polish off this new persistance mech.
Looking forward to making an adapter that allows me to import all my
WinStar and Goravani Jyotish files. WinStar looks easy. So far, GJ looks
difficult. We'll see.<br>
- Created the new IStorageCenter implementation called FileCenter, that
makes use of the read/write native file classes created in previous days.<br>
- Adapted the ChartCenter to this new form of storing charts<br>
- Integrated it all with the FreeJyotish front end. Thank god for
interfaces. The whole thing took about 10 minutes. All working fine.<br>
- Realized later that I had the charts reading in correctly, but hadn't
hooked up writing at all. Charts were disappearing after closing the
program. This has been corrected.<br>
- Began work on an importer for WinStar export files. Read up some on
parsing. Turns out the WinStar file is highly regular, and shouldn't be
*too* tough to import correctly. We'll see.<br>
- Today was a magnum opus day, seems like sometimes everything happens
all at once.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 18 APR 03</span><br>
- Slogged forward tonight on the WinStar file importer. It's all<br>
straightforward, tedious work. But coming along fine. The first version
will be for testing only, with hard-coded path and filename arguments.
But I'll be able to import all those charts. That was about it today. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 19 APR 03 </span><br>
- Finished WinStar file importer. Imported (almost) all birth data from
my WinStar application.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 21 APR 03</span><br>
- Another Linux tragedy wipes out my home directory. At least the rest
of the installation is fine. This is the problem with being a *nix
newbie. Unfortunately, my big piece of work, the WinStar importer is a
casualty of this crash. Ugh. :(<br>
- Backup everything to cvs everyday...OK?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 25 APR 03</span><br>
- Planned extensively for construction of the new calculation back end.
It's a complex process (at least for me).<br>
- Sent out document of planned calculator to other developers on the
project to see what they thought of it. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 26 APR 03</span><br>
- Emails back and forth with Ken regarding new calculator. He is
recommending using a flexible form of Java object that I've never seen
before. Basically, rather than defining variables and then having the
standard get/set methods, this type of object is basically a Hashtable
on a stick. That way it can hold as many of whatever kind of variables
you choose, and as long as you know the names you stored them under, you
can get them back out and cast them correctly. Has only on get/set pair,
which is really a get/put pair. Very interestink...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 28 APR 03</span><br>
- Created new CalculationPreferences object based on the ideas outlined
on the 26th.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 29 APR 03</span><br>
- Created new WriteCalculationPreferences and
ReadCalculationPreferences objects, that can - oddly enough - right and
read the new kind of CalculationPreferences object. Tested this
extensively. Works like a charm. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 30 APR 03</span><br>
- Tonight was a BIG night. Got the new freejyotish.main.calc
calculation system up and running finally. Currently able to switch
zodiacs and ayanamsas. This took several hours to get working and iron
out all the wrinkles.<br>
- Removed at least 9 old files from the current working directory, and
put them in the attic.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 1 MAY 03</span><br>
Welcome to the 3-letter month.<br>
- Got the chart calculation routine to switch between true/mean nodes.
This was much more painful than it needed to be. And I'm not happy with
the torturous complexity of the code. It's not easy to read, and I don't
think it's maintainable. But it does *work.*<br>
- Got the three currently working calculation preferences hooked up and
working in the UI.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 2 MAY 03 </span><br>
- THE MOST EXALTED PLANETS IN THE LAST 1000 YEARS TODAY - SEVEN PLANETS
EXALTED<br>
- Created a TabbedPane panel and set several widgets inside it. Loaded
it into FJSplit for a look. It's excellent. This should save a lot of
screen real estate.<br>
- Got the cursor to change to "wait" during calculations<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 3 MAY 03</span><br>
- Reworked how varga data is created, stored, and used, to work better
with new back-end.<br>
- <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 4 MAY 03</span><br>
- Created AstakavargaCalculator from old file and fixed it to work with
FreeJyotish<br>
- Created JTable to display AV data and added it to FJTabbedPanel<br>
- Created a generic display for basic house cusp data and added it to
FJTabbedPanel<br>
- FJ is starting to look a lot better.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 5 MAY 03</span><br>
- Fixed some minor stuff with the above (4 May) displays<br>
- Spent a lot of time getting my main coding box re-set up. Took out
the old motherboard, which featured a PII 350 mHz, and replaced it with
an AMD XP 1800, which runs at about 1.5 mHz. The difference is
unbelievable, and the upgrade was super-cheap, also.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 6 MAY 03</span><br>
- Got a large number of excellent GUI suggestions from Ken, including
some sample code. Summary of these suggestions include information-rich
tool-tips, a plethora of pop-up menus, and a general redesign around the
tabs/popups combination. Very interesting.<br>
- Played around a little bit with the GUI, trying out some of Ken's
ideas<br>
- Began serious work on code to import birth records from a Goravani
Jyotish output file. Looking forward to getting this up and running, as
I have several hundred charts in this format. Got pretty far with it.
The file format is fairly easy to parse. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 8 MAY 03</span><br>
- Created importer for Goravani Jyotish files. (Still very buggy,
though)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 15 MAY 03 </span><br>
- Beautiful lunar eclipse tonight, right on my natal moon. Ketu
darshana.<br>
- Got the House system preference working in the HouseDataCalculator,
at least in a beta test format.<br>
- Began hooking up the House system preference in the ChartCalcPrefs
dialog, but ran into Class Cast problems I couldn't quite sort out.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> 17 MAY 03</span><br>
- Created two exception handling classes for freejyotish.main.calc<br>
- Created a BirthDataValidator<br>
- Began building the BDV into the calculation sequence, and testing the
exception handling classes<br>
- FJ welcomes a new programmer on board: Santosh Deshpande, a java guru
from Bangalore. Welcome, Santosh!<br>
- Recent talks on FJ programming directions center around spending some
time fixing up what is already there, rather than implementing new
features. This includes:<br>
1. Writing unit tests for everything (read: Magnum Opus)<br>
2. Creating and implementing more exception handling and error checking
code<br>
3. Standardizing and cleaning up all variable names, class name, etc.<br>
4. Standardizing and cleaning up code formatting<br>
5. Creating the foundation for I18N<br>
6. Creating a new preferences implementation<br>
7. Reworking the foundations of the GUI <br>
8. Lots more, etc.<br>
So, this will begin a retrograde period with FJ, wherein we toughen it
up for the real world. <br>
